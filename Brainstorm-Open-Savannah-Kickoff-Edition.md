# üí°Brainstorm: Open Savannah! Kickoff Edition

# Goal for Event

To leave with a feasible idea for a first civic tech project by the end of the evening, as well as having made a convincing argument for the value of open government and open data in improving quality of life ‚Äì both through a talk and through a miniature civic app for getting in touch with your neighborhood association president (possibly using CityBook + Google Sheets).


## Preliminary Notes/Possible Projects
- Lightning talk re: working with Code for Greenville to build a real-time trolley tracker, and the need for any sort of real-time transit bus tracking system for CAT in Savannah. Have made contact with CAT and confirmed. **Update: Grant Sparks of CAT can no longer make it, but I should be able to summarize his pitch for him. -CVL**
- Saja from PIO possibly willing to talk briefly about openness of City in working with us?
## Visual Inspirations

Time and again, it seems that out-of-town software vendors have come in, signed multi-year contracts, then largely failed to do what they promised. Example: Company contracted by CAT still hasn‚Äôt followed through on any of its plans, and is hard to reach for support.

No more enterprise software companies!

We all know what‚Äôs broken; there‚Äôs just not the municipal budget to fix it.

But, on flip side, this is actually kind of amazing work from SCMPD on a huge issue:

Now if only we could get them to start sharing underlying machine-readable crime data from those PDFs they post each week‚Ä¶

## PITCH TO THOSE ON THE FENCE: 

We may be disillusioned with politics, but politics is not government. To give up on government is to give up on ourselves.

| School performance metrics that you could graph by economic, demographic, budget data.  We have a hard time explaining the issues between specialty programs and neighborhood schools.

I wonder how much of that could be accomplished through the basic open data portal.

## Miniature Demo-Hacknight Example

Using http://CityBook.io framework with Google Sheets to create a hyperlocal contact book app for individual neighborhoods to contact their neighborhood association presidents, their aldermen, the nearest social, legal services and so-on. May not fill big need but would show participants that you don't have to know coding to help build stuff, and that innovative applications can literally take less than an hour to build. This is something we‚Äôd try to make sure we had enough laptops for so that attendees could break into groups of 4-5 people each, ideally with at least one ‚Äòtech‚Äô person, and enter in data in a collaborative Google Sheet workbook. Then we literally paste in the workbook URL and CityBook spits out an app URL that we can get a short URL for for maybe $10. And if someone feels frisky after the event, we could even wrap it in Electron or customize it with React Native, but that's probably taking it too far. It's meant more as an exercise than an actual product.

## Action items
[ ] For @Gary S - Let‚Äôs write a 1-2 pg. proposal following the project decision summarizing what we plan to do for first project. Also, in meantime, maybe a MoU for City, CAT, SEDA, Creative Coast and others? Get @patrick@opensavannah.org on board with you for this one.
[ ] For @Josef S:  Continue with the awesome digging for neighborhood association leadership. And reach out and make contact when you can? 
[ ] @Kevin L - Keep wearing the white hat üé©  and stealthily helping out despite your public wishes not to bite off more than you can chew.
[ ] WE NEED SOME BRIGADE LEADERSHIP DIVERSITY, YALL! Seriously, not a single female yet? Smh. :p
