# ‚õëÔ∏è Brigade Core Leadership and General Leadership Roles

## **OPEN SAVANNAH BRIGADE LEADERS & CORE TEAM MEMBERS**

Generally, there are two types of leadership roles for the Open Savannah brigade: the Core Leadership Team and the General Brigade Leadership. **Core Leadership Team members hold more official roles with a commitment of at least 1-2 hours per week of outside work** and administrator-level account access to all Open Savannah accounts, while the **General Brigade Leadership Team provides a formalized but less time-consuming role** for Brigade Members who may be on the fence about making a commitment, but still want to play an active role in Brigade leadership efforts.

## **Other Non-Core Leadership Roles üõéÔ∏è** 

If you want to be involved but actually *do* have a pretty full plate, there‚Äôs still plenty of ways to contribute.

üèõÔ∏è **Government Partnership Liaison - Position Filled by** @P B ?
The Government Liaison is the chief brigade diplomat to local and regional government agencies. He/she cultivates working relationships with key contacts at each agency, and has a rolodex of contacts at her disposal (if rolodexes actually still existed, of course). The ability to work with, not for, municipal government, and to show sound temperament when dealing with people with busy schedules is of utmost importance.

üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß **Brigade Evangelists - Multiple Desired**
The Brigade Evangelist is a Brigade member who is a cheerleader and representative of the civic hacker movement. The Brigade Evangelist upholds the values of the Brigade and will report back to the Leader/s or Captain/s about interesting opportunities or contacts. Often this brigade member can be found representing their local brigade at government meetings, other meetups, and community functions. 
This role requires personality, adaptability, and great communication skills. Technical proficiency is not a requirement, but having the ability to weigh ideas that use technology is.

üõ¢Ô∏è **Community Data Wranglers - Multiple Desired**
A community data wrangler is a talented data librarian. They work with the community and local officials to ensure the wider availability of data. In some cases this includes the implementation of a community built data portal.
This role requires some depth of technology experience and understanding of data sets. Ideally, this person has the bandwidth to answer emailed questions and attend Brigade meetings on a regular basis.

üìã **Scribe - Position Vacant**
The Strategic Communications Lead is someone who takes notes at Brigade events and posts them ; helps keeps track of city council minutes and public hearings and reports back at hacknights; helps write training materials; keeps local wikis up to date; and/or writes software documentation. 
This role requires strength in written communication and time to email and call local media. 

üóùÔ∏è **Senior Developers - Multiple Desired**
A Senior Developer acts as a mentor to other Brigade members and/or out of Brigade network individuals working on Brigade created products. Sometimes this person takes on a role as a repo manager. Senior Developers are common throughout technical communities and play the same role within a Brigade. Their primary role makes new Brigade members feel welcomed and provide mentoring/coaching. As you can imagine, this role requires technical experience, time, and patience.

üéâ **Policy Evangelists - Multiple Desired**
A policy evangelist acts as a mentor to other Brigade members and helps educate the public and officials on open government, open data, and on the civic hacking practice. Within our communities, Law and Policy are ‚Äúcode‚Äù for physical space. Software is code for the digital space. 
Policy evangelists are dedicated to understanding their municipal policy on Open Government, Open data, et. al. In some cases cases, this role is spread out to small working groups to share notes on policy opportunities and have discussions with government agencies. This role requires patience, a really good networker, and a dash of political savviness.

üìÖ **Event Organizer//Meeting Runner - Position Vacant**
One of the most important roles is being an event organizer. Events enable the Brigade to exist. Several Brigades have found it helpful to have Brigade members rotate event logistics. It is not that you need someone to do everything in organizing an event, i.e. planning partnerships and programing. You need someone who can book space, arrange equipment, refreshments, set up, configure registration, etc... 
This role requires the skills reserved for a party planner.

## Other roles that are being developed:
- *Trainer:* someone who can help train and facilitate education across your brigade.
- *Member support:* someone who can be a single point of contact to help bring people into your brigade and walk them through a ladder of participation.
- *Non-profit / Community group Liaison: this is someone who can or has ‚Äúwalk a mile in the shoes of others.‚Äù not a naysayer, but someone who can translate the work and values of non-profit or community groups into a conversation.* 
- *Advisory board:* A group of three to four influential leaders, academics, public officials and/or activists from the business community, local media or other role of civic value who together serve to provide strategic advice to the brigade.
