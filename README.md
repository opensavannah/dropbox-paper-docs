## Getting Started Notes 📋 
- This paper and all Open Savannah Dropbox papers are set to be made publicly viewable to anyone with the link by default. 👀
- 🗂️ All brigade papers are contained in the `Open Savannah` team folder, which any member can gain access to by sending an email to the brigade leadership team at [yall@opensavannah.org](mailto: yall@opensavannah.org). Be sure to make the subject line of the email `OPEN SAVANNAH DROPBOX PAPER INVITE REQUEST` and leave the body of the email blank.
- Any and all papers created can (and should!) be shared with the public by copying the Sharing link in the top right corner. 🔓 t
- For the time being, since not everyone can publicly view the Open Savannah **folder** without waiting for request approval, **please ensure that you link to all newly-created Open Savannah papers in the table below.** You can link to other Open Savannah papers by typing `+` and entering  the first few characters of the paper name until it appears. You can also add emoji with `:`  and use `@` to mention other members.
- Dropbox Paper is not meant as a replacement for GitHub or Google Docs. Use GitHub for all project documentation or more formal living documents, such as MoUs and the Code of Conduct. Only use Google Docs for documents that need to have a more print-friendly styling.
- Yes, DB paper does accept basic markdown in addition to providing an inline WYSIWYG styling panel.
- **NOTE:** To download documents in Markdown format for use on GitHub, you must be on Desktop, not mobile.
